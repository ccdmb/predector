## Quick install

### Requirements

- 4 CPUs
- 8 GB RAM
- About 20-30 GB of free disk space (~15 GB for all of the software, the rest depends on what you're running).
- A bash terminal in a unix-type environment, we primarily test on the current ubuntu LTS.

Only the last two are really hard requirements.
You might get away with running smaller genomes on a smaller computer, but I would say
most modern laptops meet these criteria.

### Optional - Remove previous software environments for old versions of the pipeline

The software environments that we provide are quite specific to different versions of the pipeline. If you are updating to use a new version of the pipeline, you should also re-build the software environment for the new version.

To remove old versions of the software environment:

```
# conda
conda env remove -n predector
# or if you installed to a directory
conda env remove -p /path/to/conda/env

# docker
OLD_VERSION=1.1.1
docker rmi -f predector/predector-base:${OLD_VERSION}
docker rmi -f predector/predector:${OLD_VERSION}
```

Singularity container files can simply be deleted if you like.
Docker commands may require sudo depending on how your computer is set up.


### 1. Install Conda, Docker, or Singularity

We provide automated ways of installing dependencies using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environments (linux OS only), or [docker](https://www.docker.com/why-docker) or [singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularity/) containers.

Please follow the instructions at one of the following links to install:

- https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html
- https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
- https://sylabs.io/guides/

> We cannot support conda environments on Mac or Windows.
> This is because some older software included in SignalP 3 and 4 is not compiled for these operating systems, and being closed source we cannot re-compile them.
> Even windows WSL2 does not seem to play well with SignalP 4.
> 
> Please use a full Linux virtual machine (e.g. a cloud server or locally in [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)) or one of the containerised options.

If you are running conda, we can also build the environment using [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Functionally there is no difference between mamba and conda environments, but mamba is faster at building the environment.
Just install mamba into your base `conda` environment (or install [mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge) instead of miniconda) and select the `mamba` option later.

> Please note. We **strongly** recommend the containerised environments (docker or singularity) if the option is available to you.
> The vast majority of issues we've helped people with have been related to poor isolation from the host environment or broken conda dependencies (which we have little control over other than vigilance).
> Containers sidestep both of these issues.
> We're more than happy to support conda and help you with any issues, but if you want to avoid issues I suggest using docker or singularity.


### 2. Download the proprietary software dependencies

Predector runs several tools that we cannot download for you automatically.
Please register for and download each of the following tools, and place them all somewhere that you can access from your terminal.
Where you have a choice between versions for different operating systems, you should always take the **Linux** version (even if using Mac or Windows).

- [SignalP](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/SignalP-3.0/9-Downloads.php#) version 3.0
- [SignalP](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/SignalP-4.1/9-Downloads.php#) version 4.1g
- [SignalP](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/SignalP-5.0/9-Downloads.php#) version 5.0b
- [SignalP](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/SignalP-6.0/9-Downloads.php#) version 6.0g "fast" **\*currently optional**
- [TargetP](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/TargetP-2.0/9-Downloads.php#) version 2.0
- [DeepLoc](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/DeepLoc-1.0/9-Downloads.php#) version 1.0
- [TMHMM](https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM-2.0/9-Downloads.php#) version 2.0c
- [Phobius](http://software.sbc.su.se/cgi-bin/request.cgi?project=phobius) version 1.01

Note that DTU (SignalP etc) don't keep older patches and minor versions available.
If the specified version isn't available to download, another version with the same major number _should_ be fine.
But please also let us know that the change has happened, so that we can update documentation and make sure our installers handle them correctly.

I suggest storing these all in a folder and just copying the whole lot around.
If you use Predector often, you'll likely re-build the environment fairly often.

> We've been having some teething problems with SignalP 6. Until this is resolved I've made installing and running it optional.
> You don't have to install SignalP6, though I recommend you try to.


### 3. Build the conda environment or container

We provide an install script that should install the dependencies for the majority of users.

In the following command, substitute the assigned value of `ENVIRONMENT` for `conda`, `mamba`, `docker`, or `singularity` as suitable.
Make sure you're in the same directory as the proprietary source archives.
If the names below don't match the filenames you have exactly, adjust the command accordingly.
For singularity and docker container building you may be prompted for your root password (via `sudo`).

```bash
ENVIRONMENT=docker

curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ccdmb/predector/1.2.7-alpha/install.sh" \
| bash -s "${ENVIRONMENT}" \
    -3 signalp-3.0.Linux.tar.Z \
    -4 signalp-4.1g.Linux.tar.gz \
    -5 signalp-5.0b.Linux.tar.gz \
    -6 signalp-6.0g.fast.tar.gz \
    -t targetp-2.0.Linux.tar.gz \
    -d deeploc-1.0.All.tar.gz \
    -m tmhmm-2.0c.Linux.tar.gz \
    -p phobius101_linux.tar.gz
```

This will create the conda environment (named `predector`), or the docker (tagged `predector/predector:1.2.7-alpha`) or singularity (file `./predector.sif`) containers.

**Take note of the message given upon completion**, which will tell you how to use the container or environment with Predector.

If you don't want to install SignalP 6 you can exclude the `-6 filename.tar.gz` argument.

The install script has some minor options that allow you to customise how and where things are built.
You can also save the install script locally and run `install.sh --help` to find more information.

```
-n|--name         -- For conda, sets the environment name (default: 'predector').
                     For docker, sets the image tag (default: 'predector/predector:1.2.7-alpha').
                     For singularity, sets the output image filename (default: './predector.sif').
-c|--conda-prefix -- If set, use this as the location to store the built conda
                     environment instead of setting a name and using the default
                     prefix. This is useful if the location that conda is installed in is restricted somehow,
                     or if it isn't available as a shared drive if on a cluster.
--conda-template  -- Use this conda environment.yml file instead of downloading it from github.
                     Only affects conda installs.
-v|--version      -- The version of the pipeline that you want to
                     setup dependencies for. Note that this may not work in
                     general, and you're recommended to use the install.sh
                     script for the targeted version.
```

Note that the `-s` in `bash -s` is a bash flag rather than for our install script.
It is only necessary if the script is coming into bash from stdin (as in the `curl -s URL | bash` command), and it tells bash that any [further arguments should go to the script rather than the bash runtime itself](https://linux.die.net/man/1/bash).
If you are running like `bash ./install.sh ...` you don't need the `-s`.


### 4. Install NextFlow

NextFlow requires a bash compatible terminal, and Java version 8+.
We require NextFlow version 21 or above.
Extended install instructions are available at: [https://www.nextflow.io/](https://www.nextflow.io).

```bash
curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash
```

Or using conda:

```bash
conda install -c bioconda nextflow>=21
```

### 5. Test the pipeline

Use one of the commands below using information given upon completion of dependency install script.
**Make sure you use the environment that you specified in [Step 3](#3--Build-the-conda-environment-or-container).**

Using conda:

```bash
nextflow run -profile test -with-conda /home/username/path/to/environment -resume -r 1.2.7-alpha ccdmb/predector
```

Using docker:

```bash
nextflow run -profile test,docker -resume -r 1.2.7-alpha ccdmb/predector

# if your docker configuration requires sudo use this profile instead
nextflow run -profile test,docker_sudo -resume -r 1.2.7-alpha ccdmb/predector
```

Using singularity:

```bash
nextflow run -profile test -with-singularity path/to/predector.sif -resume -r 1.2.7-alpha ccdmb/predector

# or if you've build the container using docker and it's in your local docker registry.
nextflow run -profile test,singularity -resume -r 1.2.7-alpha ccdmb/predector
```

## Extended dependency install guide

If the quick install method doesn't work for you, you might need to run the environment build steps manually.
It would be great if you could also contact us to report the issue, so that we can get the quick install instructions working for more people.

The following guides assume that you have successfully followed the steps 1, 2, and 4, and aim to replace step 3.

### Building the conda environment the long way

We provide a conda environment file that can be downloaded and installed.
This environment contains several "placeholder" packages to deal with the proprietary software.
Essentially, these placeholder packages contain scripts to take the source files of the
proprietary software, and install them into the conda environment for you.

**It is necessary to run both of the code blocks below to properly install the environment.**

First we create the conda environment, which includes the non-proprietary dependencies and the "placeholder" packages.

```bash
# Download the environment config file.
curl -o environment.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ccdmb/predector/1.2.7-alpha/environment.yml

# Create the environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate predector
```

To complete the installation we need to run the `*-register` scripts, which install the proprietary source archives you downloaded yourself.
You can copy-paste the entire command below directly into your terminal.
Modify the source tar archive filenames in the commands if necessary.

```bash
signalp3-register signalp-3.0.Linux.tar.Z \
&& signalp4-register signalp-4.1g.Linux.tar.gz \
&& signalp5-register signalp-5.0b.Linux.tar.gz \
&& signalp6-register signalp-6.0g.fast.tar.gz \
&& targetp2-register targetp-2.0.Linux.tar.gz \
&& deeploc-register deeploc-1.0.All.tar.gz \
&& phobius-register phobius101_linux.tar.gz \
&& tmhmm2-register tmhmm-2.0c.Linux.tar.gz
```

If any of the `*-register` scripts fail, please contact the authors or raise an issue on github (we'll try to have an FAQ setup soon).


### Building the Docker container the long way

For docker and anything that supports docker images we have a [prebuilt container on DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/predector/predector-base) containing all of the open-source components.
To install the proprietary software we use this image as a base to build on with a new dockerfile.
To build the new image with the proprietary dependencies, you need to run the command below which can all be copy-pasted directly into your terminal.
Modify the source `.tar` archive filenames in the command if necessary.
Depending on how you installed docker you may need to use `sudo docker` in place of `docker`.

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ccdmb/predector/1.2.7-alpha/Dockerfile \
| docker build \
  --build-arg SIGNALP3=signalp-3.0.Linux.tar.Z \
  --build-arg SIGNALP4=signalp-4.1g.Linux.tar.gz \
  --build-arg SIGNALP5=signalp-5.0b.Linux.tar.gz \
  --build-arg SIGNALP6=signalp-6.0g.fast.tar.gz \
  --build-arg TARGETP2=targetp-2.0.Linux.tar.gz \
  --build-arg PHOBIUS=phobius101_linux.tar.gz \
  --build-arg TMHMM=tmhmm-2.0c.Linux.tar.gz \
  --build-arg DEEPLOC=deeploc-1.0.All.tar.gz \
  -t predector/predector:1.2.7-alpha \
  -f - \
  .
```

Your container should now be available as `predector/predector:1.2.7-alpha` in your docker registry `docker images`.


### Building the Singularity container the long way

There are a few ways to build the singularity image with the proprietary software installed (the filename `predector.sif` in the sections below).

If you only have singularity installed, you can build the container directly
by downloading the `.def` file and setting some environment variables with the
paths to the proprietary source archives.
The following commands will build this image for you, and can be copy-pasted directly into your terminal.
Modify the source tar archive filenames if necessary.

```bash
# This is used to emulate the --build-args functionality of docker.
# Singularity lacks this feature. You can unset the variables after you're done.
export SIGNALP3=signalp-3.0.Linux.tar.Z
export SIGNALP4=signalp-4.1g.Linux.tar.gz
export SIGNALP5=signalp-5.0b.Linux.tar.gz
export SIGNALP6=signalp-6.0g.fast.tar.gz
export TARGETP2=targetp-2.0.Linux.tar.gz
export PHOBIUS=phobius101_linux.tar.gz
export TMHMM=tmhmm-2.0c.Linux.tar.gz
export DEEPLOC=deeploc-1.0.All.tar.gz

# Download the .def file
curl -o ./singularity.def https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ccdmb/predector/1.2.7-alpha/singularity.def

# Build the .sif singularity image.
# Note that `sudo -E` is important, it tells sudo to keep the environment variables
# that we just set.
sudo -E singularity build \
  predector.sif \
  ./singularity.def
```

If you've already built the container using docker, you can convert them to singularity format.
You don't need to use `sudo` even if your docker installation usually requires it.

```bash
singularity build predector.sif docker-daemon://predector/predector:1.2.7-alpha
```


Because the container images are quite large, `singularity build` will sometimes fail if your `/tmp` partition isn't big enough.
In that case, set the following environment variables and remove the cache directory (`rm -rf -- "${PWD}/cache"`) when `singularity build` is finished.

```bash
export SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR="${PWD}/cache"
export SINGULARITY_TMPDIR="${PWD}/cache"
export SINGULARITY_LOCALCACHEDIR="${PWD}/cache"
```


## Copying environments to places where you don't have root user permission

We can't really just put the final container images up on dockerhub or singularity hub,
since that would violate the proprietary license agreements.
So if you don't have root user permission on the computer (e.g. a supercomputing cluster) you're going to run the analysis on you can either use the conda environments or build a container on a different computer and copy the image up.


If the option is available to you, I would recommend using the singularity containers for HPC.
Singularity container `.sif` files can be simply copied to whereever you're running the analysis.


Some supercomputing centres will have [`shifter`](https://docs.nersc.gov/programming/shifter/overview/) installed, which allows you to run jobs with docker containers. Note that there are two versions of `shifter` and nextflow only supports one of them (the nersc one).
Docker containers can be saved as a tarball and copied wherever you like.

```bash
# You could pipe this through gzip if you wanted.
docker save predector/predector:1.2.7-alpha > predector.tar
```

And on the other end

```bash
docker load -i predector.tar
```


Conda environments should be able to be built anywhere, since they don't require root user permission.
You should just be able to follow the instructions described earlier.
Just make sure that you install the environment on a shared filesystem (i.e. one that all nodes in your cluster can access).

There are also options for "packing" a conda environment into something that you can copy around (e.g. [conda-pack](https://conda.github.io/conda-pack/)), though we haven't tried this yet.


Hopefully, one of these options will work for you.
